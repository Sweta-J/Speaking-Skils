Sir you want to test my knowledge about <b id="1">______</b>, or check my English sbeaking skills. My knowledge about <b id="2">______</b> is limited, but my knowledge about the English language is unlimited. I understand noun, pronoun, adjective, verb, adverb, conjunction, colon, semicolon and full stob. I make conversation confidently with any English person, prince Charles, wife Diana, mother-in-law Queen Elizabeth bart II. I find it very disturbing that your esteemed organization is trying to judge me by my knowledge about <b id="3">______</b> and not by my English grammar. You must re-examine your examination system because it is about English and not about <b id="4">______</b>. </p>
